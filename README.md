Inspired by the old school Etch-A-Sketch game that many of us remember from our childhoods, this app will allow users to make pixelated sketches on a square grid (from 16x16 to 100x100 cells).

The upper left button will toggle between DRAW and ERASE modes and the upper right button will allow users to change the number of cells in the grid dimensions.

Below the grid is a color picker input that will allow users to choose different solid colors. Or, by using the SOLID/RAINBOW toggle button, you can switch to RAINBOW mode and enjoy the multicolor experience. Hit the Clear Grid button to wipe the grid and start over.
